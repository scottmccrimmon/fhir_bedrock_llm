### Project Objective

Design and implement an **LLM-based AI engineering pipeline** that ingests **unstructured clinical documents**, extracts and codifies medically relevant concepts, and persists the results in **HL7 FHIR-compliant resources**, with engineering rigor suitable for enterprise healthcare environments.

### Strategic Motivation

This project is designed to:

- Build **hands-on experience** with LLM-powered clinical data pipelines
    
- Practice **AI engineering patterns** relevant to large healthcare organizations
    
- Lay groundwork for downstream **clinical and business analytics use cases**, such as reducing readmissions, minimizing medical errors, and improving care coordination
